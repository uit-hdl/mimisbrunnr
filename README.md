## General Info
This is the public repository for both the code and results, in any of the social network papers.

There is no data in here due privacy reasons, if you want to run the code, use the random data files where you won't get the same results at all, but at least you get the idea on how the code works.

## Technologies
* R 3.0+

## Setup
