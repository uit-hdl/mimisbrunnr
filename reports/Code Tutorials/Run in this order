If you want to run everything from zero, use this order:


(TODO) install.R

    This makes sure that all your packages are available, and if they don't, it
    will try to intall them automatically.

    You might still get an error prompting that you need to install some system
    libraries manually in Linux, like the "libcurl-openssl" for example before
    you install the "curl" package dependency.

    You only need to run this once. It will take some relative long time to
    download and compile all the sources thoght if you have a fresh instalation
    of R.

tools.R

    All the functions that you need to run the program.

dataCleaning.R

    If you want to clean all the data from scratch. You need to run this if you
    have never run it before and the /dataframe_ready folder is empty. Otherwise
    you can skip it.

load.R

    As the name suggest, it load all the dataframes into memory.


aureus.R
network.R
generalAnalysis.R

     Each of the analysis. Run whathever you need, or all of them if you want.

latex.R

     The script that take care of creating the latex document.

(TODO) HTML.R

     The script that take care of creating the notebook and the HTML report.
